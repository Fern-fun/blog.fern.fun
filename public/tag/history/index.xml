      <description>Hello, dear readers! Today, we want to share with you the story of how this website came to be and reveal the secret we used. Our group of programmers decided to choose a framework for building a blog that would provide us with efficient and flexible tools, allowing us to focus on content without wasting time on configuration and complex solutions. And thus, Hugo enters the stage!
Hugo is an exceptional framework for generating static websites.</description>
